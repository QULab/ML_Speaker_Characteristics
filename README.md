# Predictive modeling for speaker characterization

#### Overview

I will be adding my predictive modeling scripts and results to this repository, as a manner of communicating my ideas combining code, data, and visualizations. My research is outlined [here](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=lfernandez) and can also be followed in [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura_Fernandez_Gallardo).

**No audio** or means to recover the speech recording sessions are provided. Speakers' names are pseudo anonymized.

* Classification:
* Regression:
* Database:  [Nautilus Speaker Characterization (NSC) Corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus) 
	* clean conversational speech from 300 German speakers and labels of interpersonal traits (likability, confidence, maturity, etc.) obtained by subjective listening.
